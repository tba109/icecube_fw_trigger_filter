This is me testing out ways of doing fixed-point binary arithmetic in python. 

The decimal package is only base 10, so doesn't really do what I want it to. 

Simple-Python-Fixed-Point-Module 0.5 looks promising...

Really simple ipython example:
In [1]: import FixedPoint as fp
In [2]: x = fp.FXnum(0.1,fp.FXfamily(5)); print "%.8f" % x
0.09375000

This looks like the right way to go!
